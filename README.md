Hello, I'm Yue Jian👋

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a budding data enthusiast and product lover currently pursuing a Master's in Computational Analysis and Public Policy at The University of Chicago. With a passion for transforming complex data into actionable insights, I specialize in machine learning, statistical analysis, and policy-driven data interpretation.

## 📊 My Data Science Journey
My journey in data science has been marked by a blend of rigorous academic training and hands-on experience. Here's a snapshot of my path so far:

1. ByteDance Monetization Intern: User Satisfaction Research, Metrics Defining, Machine Learning
2. Experiment Research in Wuhan University with Prof. Shuo Yang: A/B testing, Bootstrap, Experiment Design
3. Natural Langauge Processing: build a [text comment classifier to predict the violation rate with hyperparameter pipeline](https://github.com/jiany1020/NLP_notes/blob/main/Text_Classifier.ipynb)
4. [GPS Trajetory Data and Social Connection Research](https://github.com/jiany1020/GPS-Data-Analysis): large-scale data imputing (BigQuery), network analysis, NLP, Bayes, GIS and Spatial Analysis
7. World Resources Institute Intern: Data Visualization


## 🔍 Areas of Interest
1. Statistical Inference and A/B Testing: Fascinated by the power of data to make informed decisions.
2. Machine Learning Applications: Keen on developing models that can predict and inform decisions making.
3. Public Policy Analysis: Combining data science with public policy to influence and improve community outcomes.
4. Behavioral and Experimental Economics: Conducting research about how social information and mechanism design can influence one's decisions

## 🌱 What I'm Learning Now
1. Advanced Techniques in Machine Learning: Continually upgrading my ML skills to stay at the forefront of technology.
2. Front-end Design: Designing amazing and user-friendly products interfaces

## 🤝 Collaborate with Me
I'm always open to collaborating on projects that leverage data for social good, particularly in areas intersecting public policy and technology. If you're working on something where my background and skills could be of use, let's connect!
